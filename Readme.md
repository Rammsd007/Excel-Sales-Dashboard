# 📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel Portfolio Project)

## 💡 Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Excel Dashboard** that analyzes sales data across various product categories and store locations. It highlights trends, key metrics, and interactive insights using slicers and charts.

I built this dashboard from scratch, resolved issues with hidden data, added KPIs, and transformed a raw Excel sheet into a fully interactive business tool.

## 📖 Case Study Summary

> Initially, the raw dataset was missing a store ("Technologia"), which caused gaps in pivot charts. After investigating hidden filters and using `TRIM` to clean store names, I fixed the issue and restored accurate visualizations.

I also customized the layout with a background image, used consistent color themes, added proper currency formatting (₹), and wrote explanations to make the dashboard **interview-ready** and client-presentable.
